## üìä How It Works

### Step 0: Job Application population
- You must add your jobs via a post request to http://localhost:5001/jobs similar to this
```json
  {
    "title": "Bomboclaat Engineer",
    "location": "Leuven, BE",
    "job_type": "Full-time",
    "experience_level": "Junior",
    "description": "We are looking for a skilled bomboclaat engineer to join our team.",
    "salary": "‚Ç¨ 120k-300k",
    "requirements": [
        "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field",
        "3+ years of experience in software development",
        "Proficiency in Patience and Sleep depravation"
    ],
    "deadline": "2025-04-01"
}
```

### Step 1: Job Application Submission
- Candidates browse available job positions on the platform
- They select a position and complete the application form
- The candidate uploads their CV (PDF format)

### Step 2: Automated CV Screening
- The system uses Google's Gemini AI to parse the CV
- Key information is extracted: education, skills, experience
- A matching score is calculated based on job requirements
- The application is stored in the system with its score

### Step 3: AI Phone Interview
- If the application meets the basic requirements, an AI agent calls the candidate
- The AI conducts a short, focused interview to assess:
  - Technical skills relevant to the position
  - Experience level
  - Notice period
  - General fit and interest in the position
- The conversation is recorded and transcribed

### Step 4: Interview Analysis and Reporting
- After the call, the AI generates a concise report including:
  - Summary of the interview
  - Pros of the candidate
  - Potential concerns or areas to explore
  - AI's general assessment
- The report is emailed to the recruiter for review

### Step 5: Human Decision Making
- The recruiter reviews the application, CV score, and interview report
- **Important**: The final hiring decision always remains with the human recruiter
- The system provides decision support, not replacement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always ensure candidate consent for AI interviews
- Keep personal data secure and compliant with privacy regulations
- The system is designed to augment human recruiters, not replace them
- Regular review of AI behavior and bias detection is recommended
