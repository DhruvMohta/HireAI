|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduction** | This was a very short interview. The candidate seemed unprepared, directly refused to answer the main question, and abruptly ended the call. |
| **Pros**        | *  Confirmed Python experience, although unspecified.                                                           |
| **Cons**        | *  Lack of experience with Flask and RESTful API development (explicitly stated).                             |
|                | *  Resistance to answering the initial technical question.                                                     |
|                | *  Abruptly ended the interview, suggesting a lack of professionalism and respect for the interviewer's time. |
|                | *  Potentially defensive or lacking confidence in their skills.                                                |
| **What AI thinks** | Based on this brief exchange, the candidate is likely not a good fit for a role requiring Flask and RESTful API development. The lack of experience and the abrupt ending of the interview raise significant concerns about their skills and professionalism. Further investigation and perhaps a more structured evaluation are definitely not recommended. The candidate did not seem interested in the role. |
